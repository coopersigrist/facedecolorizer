# facedecolorizer
Crops images into just the face and turns it into contour lines.

To run, just type `./run -x=(x shift) -y=(y shift) -name=(your name)`, replacing the paranthesis with values.

This will create a directory under the name you provided, with all the steps of our image processing inside of it.

For x and y shift, generally 15-30 seems to be good but use your judgement.
